         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

By the which barbarous and inhumane attempt, not only the ſacred Order of Biſhops, and ſafety of the perſons of the Officers and Miniſters of Religion (which amongſt Turks and Heathens, as amongſt Chriſtians, has been in all ages held inviolable, and in a ſpecial maner are ſecured by Our Laws) are in the higheſt meaſure invaded and violated; but Our Authority and Government moſt ſcandalouſly affronted and injured, and all Laws, Divine and Humane, moſt wickedly infringed, to the great reproach of the true Religion and Faith, of which we are Defender, and diſhonour of this Our Church and Kingdom. And we being, upon all accounts, moſt highly concerned to expreſs Our deteſtation of the ſaid villainous attempt of paricide and murder upon innocent perſons, the Governours of the Church, without any imaginable cauſe or provocation, but for their loyalty and affection to Us, and zeal for Our ſervice; And conſidering how much it importeth the honour of the eſtabliſhed Religion, and of Our Government, the preſervation of the Authority of Our Laws, and in ſpecial Our Acts of Parliament, anent invading and purſuing Our Privy Councellours, and doing violence to the perſons of Church-men, and the preventing of the overturning of the very beeing of Humane-ſocieties, that Aſſaſsinates be exemplarly puniſhed. And in order thereto, that all poſsible and exact endeavours be gone about for diſcovering and apprehending the ſaid Villain; Therefore, We, with advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council, command and charge all Sheriffs, Stewarts, Bailies of Regalities and their Deputes, Magiſtrates of Burghs within their reſpective Bounds and Iuriſdictions, and Officers of Our ſtanding Forces, to ſearch, ſeek, take and apprehend the perſon guilty of the ſaid horrid crime, and to impriſon him till he be brought to Iuſtice. As alſo, We command and charge all and ſundry Our Subjects of this Our Kingdom, that they uſe their utmoſt endeavours for detecting, diſcovering and apprehending the foreſaid Aſſaſsinate: And for their further incouragement therein, We do declare and give aſſurance, that whoſoever ſhall ſo diſcover him that he may be apprehended, ſhall not only be indemnified and pardoned, albeit they were acceſſory to, and art and part of the foreſaid crime, and ſhall never be called nor accuſed therefore in time coming; but ſhall likewayes have payed to them the ſum of two thouſand Merks, <hi>Scots</hi> money; and the perſon who ſhall apprehend the committer of the foreſaid crime, and deliver him to ſure Ward and Firmance, ſhall have inſtantly the ſum of five thouſand Merks payed and delivered to him.
